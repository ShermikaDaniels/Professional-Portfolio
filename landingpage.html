          Luckily, this was an authorized phishing simulation
        </p>

        <p>
          There are multiple methods a threat actor uses to get a reaction from
          the user.
          <br />
          <br />Scroll through to learn about the different methods threat
          actors use.

          <h2>Urgency</h2>

          <p><strong>Urgency</strong> is the requirement of swift action.</p>

          <p>
            The threat actor uses this feeling that you must act quickly or risk
            losing out, or face disciplinary action if not completed in the
            requested time frame.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h2>Authority</h2>

          <p>
            <strong>Authority</strong> is the power or right to give orders,
            make decisions, and enforce rules.
          </p>

          <p>
            This method is when a threat actor impersonates someone of authority
            and request something from a user. This makes the user feel like the
            request is coming from someone in charge, like a manager or CEO,
            making the user feel like they must do as requested.

      <section>
        <div>
          <h2>Consensus</h2>

          <p><strong>Consensus</strong> is a general agreement.</p>

          <p>
            This method is used when a hacker claims that the requested action
            is normal or generally accepted. For example they will word an email
            like the following:<br><br>

            <em style="font-size: 12pt;">This is Mike from payroll, I have everyone in your department
              updated W-4 form, it looks like I am just missing yours. I need
              you to send your updated W-4 over as well.</em> <br>
            People act when they believe they are in alignment with a large
            group.

      <section>
        <div>
          <h2>Scarcity</h2>

          <p>
            <strong>Scarcity</strong> is the lack of goods and services. Threat
            actors use this anxiety to compel users to act without thinking.
          </p>

          <p>The following are three examples:</p>
<ul>
          <li>You need to act quickly or risk losing out</li>

          <li>Sale ends in 30 minutes</li>

          <li>Not being able to find an item anywhere else online</li>
          </ul>

      </figure>

        <div>
          <h2>Intimidation</h2>

          <p>
            <strong>Intimidation</strong> is the use of fear in order to make
            someone do what one wants.
          </p>

          <p>
            An attacker uses this method by impersonating someone of authority
            and threatens negative action, or claims to have access to sensitive
            information and threatens to release it if you refuse to obey.
          </p>

      <section>
        <div>
          <h2>Familiarity</h2>

          <p>
            <strong>Familiarity</strong> is the close acquaintance with or
            knowledge of something.
          </p>

          <p>
            The attacker uses this method to establish a common contact, friend,
            or familiar organization to gain trust. People like what is familiar
            to them, and are comfortable around people they perceive are like
            them.

          <h2>Trust</h2>

          <p>
           <strong>Trust</strong> is the belief in the reliability, truth, ability, or strength of
            someone or something.
          </p>

          <p>
            The threat actor uses this by posing as a mutual friend, someone the
            user may know, or a familiar organization to establish a feeling of
            trust.

          <h2>Report It!</h2>

          <p>
            By questioning the validity of every email you can spot phishing
            attacks. If something seems inappropriate, unusual, or questionable
            and you cannot verify the veracity of the email,
            <strong>Report it!</strong>
