          Phishing is the fraudulent practice of sending emails or other
          messages purporting to be from reputable companies to induce
          individuals to reveal personal information, such as passwords and
          credit card numbers. Here are different types of Phishing.
        </center>
      </p>
      <h3>Vishing</h3>
      <p>
        is a type of cyber attack that uses voice and telephony technologies to
        trick targeted individuals into revealing sensitive data to unauthorized
        entities.
      </p>
      <h3>Smishing</h3>
      <p>
        is a social engineering attack that uses fake mobile text messages to
        trick people into downloading malware, sharing sensitive information, or
        sending money to cybercriminals. The term “smishing” is a combination of
        “SMS”—or “short message service,” the technology behind text
        messages—and “phishing.”
      </p>
      <h3>Social Engineering</h3>
      <p>
        all techniques aimed at talking a target into revealing specific
        information or performing a specific action for illegitimate reasons.
      </p>
      <h3>Spear Phishing</h3>
      <p>
        is an email targeted at a specific individual or department within an
        organization that appears to be from a trusted source. It's actually
        cybercriminals attempting to steal confidential information.
      </p>
      <h3>Whailing</h3>
      <p>
        is a highly targeted phishing attack - aimed at senior executives -
        masquerading as a legitimate email. Whaling is digitally enabled fraud
        through social engineering, designed to encourage victims to perform a
        secondary action, such as initiating a wire transfer of funds.
